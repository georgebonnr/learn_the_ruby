# Hi There.

This is a repo to document some interesting learning exercises I get to do as I learn Ruby.  Before April of this year (2013) I had never written a line of code, so bear in mind that these solutions may be hideous to a certain degree (hopefully a decreasing one as the months wear on).

If I throw something up in this repo, it's usually because I got to extend the challenge somehow, or I just thought it was interesting and worth sharing.

Check me out, fork me, git my number, holler back.
