This is a repo to document some interesting learning exercises I get to do as I learn Ruby.  Before April of this year (2013) I had never written a line of code, so bear in mind that these solutions may be hideous to a certain degree (hopefully a decreasing one as the months wear on).

If I commit a file on here, it's most likely because I extended the challenge in some way that I found fun, or learned something interesting from it.

Check me out, fork me, git my number, holler back.
